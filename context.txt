# Project Context: Vision-Augmented AgentFormer

## 1. Primary Goal

The main objective is to integrate the visual perception capabilities of the **BEVDepth** model into the **AgentFormer** trajectory prediction model. This involves creating a **Vision-Augmented AgentFormer** that uses a Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature map, generated from multi-view camera images, to enrich the input features for AgentFormer's trajectory forecasting module. The BEV features are to be fused with the standard trajectory data (past positions, velocities) before being processed by the Agent-Aware Attention mechanism.

## 2. Core Models & Concepts

*   **AgentFormer:** A trajectory prediction model that uses an Agent-Aware Attention mechanism to jointly model social and temporal dependencies. It primarily relies on trajectory data.
*   **BEVDepth:** A 3D object detection model that excels at creating a BEV feature map from multi-view camera images using a Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm with explicit depth prediction.
*   **Integration Plan:** The core idea is to use the visual encoder from BEVDepth (`BaseLSSFPN`) to generate a BEV map and then, for each agent, sample the visual features from the map corresponding to the agent's location. These visual features are then concatenated with the agent's motion features to create a richer, multi-modal input for the AgentFormer model.

## 3. Code Modifications and Integration Steps Completed

To achieve the integration, the following modifications were made to the `AgentFormer` codebase:

1.  **Copied BEVDepth Source Code:**
    *   The `bevdepth` directory from the `BEVDepth` repository was copied into the `AgentFormer` project at `AgentFormer/bevdepth` to make it a local module.
    *   The `ops` directory, containing custom CUDA kernels for `voxel_pooling`, was copied to `AgentFormer/ops`.
    *   A `setup.py` file was created in the `AgentFormer` root to compile these CUDA extensions.

2.  **Modified `AgentFormer/model/agentformer.py`:**
    *   In the `AgentFormer` class `__init__` method, logic was added to instantiate the `BaseLSSFPN` model from `bevdepth` as `self.bev_encoder` when a `use_bev` flag is set in the configuration.
    *   In the `set_data` method, code was added to handle the new BEV data (`sweep_imgs`, `mats_dict`) from the dataloader and move it to the correct device.
    *   In the `ContextEncoder.forward` method, the core fusion logic was implemented. This involves generating the BEV map, sampling features for each agent based on their world coordinates, and concatenating these features with the original trajectory features.

3.  **Modified `AgentFormer/data/dataloader.py`:**
    *   The `data_generator` class was modified to handle the loading of nuScenes data for the BEV encoder.
    *   It now instantiates the `NuscDetDataset` class (from the copied `bevdepth` code).
    *   The `data_root` for this dataset was explicitly set to the absolute path `/home/tharun/Documents/BTP/AgentFormer/nuscenes` to prevent path resolution errors.
    *   The `next_sample` method was updated to fetch the BEV data (`sweep_imgs`, `mats_dict`) and add it to the data dictionary that is passed to the model.
    *   **Made BEVDepth optional:** Added conditional import with helpful error messages so users can use pre-computed features without installing BEVDepth.

4.  **Modified `AgentFormer/utils/config.py`:**
    *   Default configurations required by the BEVDepth dataloader (`ida_aug_conf`, `bda_aug_conf`, `img_conf`, `object_classes`) were added directly into the `Config` class to make them available to all configurations without needing to modify individual `.yml` files.

5.  **Created Pre-computed BEV Features Pipeline:**
    *   **File:** `scripts/precompute_bev_features.py` - Extracts BEV features offline and saves to disk
    *   **Modified:** `model/bev/base_lss_fpn.py` - Fixed voxel pooling fallback with proper geometry interpolation
    *   **Modified:** `data/dataloader.py` - Added support for loading pre-computed features from disk
    *   **Benefits:** Saves 3-4GB GPU memory, ~10-15% faster training, no BEVDepth dependency needed
    *   **Storage:** ~9.77 MB per sample, ~24GB for 2,462 train_subset samples

6.  **API and Dependency Fixes:**
    *   **`mmcv.load` and `mmcv.dump`:** The `BEVDepth/scripts/gen_info.py` and `BEVDepth/bevdepth/datasets/nusc_det_dataset.py` files were updated to use `mmengine.load` and `mmengine.dump` instead of the deprecated `mmcv.load` and `mmcv.dump` to work with MMCV v2.x.
    *   **`mmdet3d` API Change:** The import path for `LiDARInstance3DBoxes` was updated from the old `mmdet3d.core.bbox.structures.lidar_box3d` to the new `mmdet3d.structures` in both `bev_utils.py` and `nusc_det_dataset.py`.
    *   **PyTorch API Change:** The `AgentFormer/model/agentformer_lib.py` file was modified to replace the use of the private and now-removed `_LinearWithBias` class with the public `torch.nn.Linear`.
    *   **Dimension Mismatches:** Fixed multiple shape mismatches in feature extraction (sweep dimensions, BDA matrix, geometry/feature resolution)
    *   **Voxel Pooling Fallback:** Implemented proper Python fallback with bilinear interpolation for geometry upsampling
