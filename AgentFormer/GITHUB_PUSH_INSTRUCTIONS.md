# GitHub Push Instructions

Your code is ready to upload! Follow these steps to push to GitHub.

## Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `vision-agentformer` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "AgentFormer with BEVDepth integration for trajectory prediction"
   - **Visibility**: Public (so others can access it)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Update Your Git Remote

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Remove the old remote pointing to original AgentFormer
git remote remove origin

# Add your new repository as the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vision-agentformer.git

# Verify it's correct
git remote -v
```

## Step 3: Push Your Code

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If prompted for credentials:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Use a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (NOT your GitHub password)

### Creating a Personal Access Token (if needed):

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "AgentFormer Upload"
4. Select scopes: Check "repo" (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when git asks

## Step 4: Verify Upload

After pushing, visit: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vision-agentformer`

You should see:
- ‚úÖ All your code files
- ‚úÖ README.md displayed on the main page
- ‚úÖ All documentation files
- ‚úÖ Scripts and model files

## Step 5: Share with Others

Send them this link with setup instructions:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vision-agentformer

Setup instructions:
1. Clone: git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vision-agentformer.git
2. Follow the SETUP_GUIDE.md for complete installation
3. See PRECOMPUTED_BEV_GUIDE.md for using pre-computed features
```

## What's Included in Your Repository

‚úÖ **Core Code:**
- Modified AgentFormer model with BEV integration
- BEV encoder (BaseLSSFPN) with fallback implementation
- Pre-computed BEV feature extraction script
- Enhanced dataloader with BEV feature loading

‚úÖ **Documentation:**
- README.md - Quick start and overview
- SETUP_GUIDE.md - Complete setup instructions
- PRECOMPUTED_BEV_GUIDE.md - Pre-computed features guide
- README_MODIFICATIONS.md - Detailed change log
- BEV_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md - Technical details

‚úÖ **Configuration:**
- Sample configs for baseline and BEV modes
- Dataset filtering scripts
- Quick pipeline test

‚úÖ **Scripts:**
- `scripts/precompute_bev_features.py` - Extract BEV features
- `scripts/filter_nuscenes_subset.py` - Filter dataset
- `scripts/gen_info_subset.py` - Generate metadata

## What's NOT Included (Excluded by .gitignore)

‚ùå **Large Files** (users download separately):
- nuScenes dataset (~30GB for 10% subset)
- Pre-computed BEV features (~24GB)
- BEVDepth repository
- Model checkpoints
- Training logs

Users will need to:
1. Download nuScenes from https://www.nuscenes.org/
2. Extract BEV features themselves OR download pre-computed ones (if you share)
3. Clone BEVDepth: `git clone https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/BEVDepth.git bevdepth`

## Optional: Add Topics/Tags to Repository

On your GitHub repository page:
1. Click "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" ‚Üí "General"
2. Scroll to "Topics"
3. Add tags: `trajectory-prediction`, `autonomous-driving`, `nuscenes`, `transformer`, `bev`, `pytorch`

## Optional: Create a Release

After pushing, create a release for easy versioning:

1. Go to your repository ‚Üí "Releases" ‚Üí "Create a new release"
2. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
3. Release title: "Vision-Augmented AgentFormer - Initial Release"
4. Description:
   ```
   Initial release of Vision-Augmented AgentFormer with BEVDepth integration.

   Features:
   - Conditional BEV integration (toggle baseline vs vision-augmented)
   - Pre-computed BEV features support
   - 10% nuScenes subset compatibility
   - Complete documentation and setup guides

   See README.md for quick start and SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.
   ```
5. Click "Publish release"

## Troubleshooting

### Push Rejected (Non-Fast-Forward)

If you get an error about non-fast-forward:

```bash
# Force push (only do this if you're sure - overwrites remote)
git push -f origin main
```

### Large File Warning

If Git warns about large files:
- Check .gitignore is working
- Remove any accidentally staged large files:
  ```bash
  git rm --cached path/to/large/file
  git commit --amend
  ```

### Authentication Failed

- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Token must have "repo" scope
- Double-check your username and token

## Next Steps After Upload

1. **Update README with your GitHub URL**:
   ```bash
   # In README.md, change:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vision-agentformer.git
   ```

2. **Add a LICENSE file** (if not already present):
   - MIT License is common for research code
   - Go to repository ‚Üí "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file" ‚Üí Name it "LICENSE"
   - GitHub will offer LICENSE templates

3. **Share your repository**:
   - Add to your research/portfolio
   - Share with collaborators
   - Cite in papers if applicable

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub's [Push Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)
2. Verify your token has correct permissions
3. Make sure repository name matches your remote URL
